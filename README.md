# My Movie - Frontend

This project was made using React during my Web Developper coding bootcamp at La Capsule, Paris.

Mymoviz is a website that displays the latest big releases by communicating with the Movie Database's API.

It allows the user to rate, like, and add a view count to each film.

API: [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
